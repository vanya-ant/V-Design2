      <h1>Design Only</h1>
      <h3>Need help?</h3>
      <p>Would you like to utilise the expertise, creativity and know-how of an interior designer, but manage the project and deal with contractors yourself?</p>
      <p>Whether you have one room that needs redecorating or you have a full-scale renovation on your hands, we can help.</p>
      <p>After an in-depth consultation we will supply a full-colour bespoke document detailing everything covered in the consultation. This will outline details and recommendations for colour scheme, spatial planning, furniture layout, lighting, furniture, soft furnishings, and accessories. Included are images and full details of each item including price, samples, and trade discount where applicable.</p>
      <p>You can then proceed with the reassurance that you are implementing a completely co-ordinated scheme that works both aesthetically and practically, avoiding expensive mistakes.</p>
